# Renaming files in bulk using Node.js involves manipulating the file system. In Node.js, the fs (file system) module provides a set of APIs for interacting with the file system, including renaming files.

# The fs.rename method is used to rename a file. It takes two arguments: the old file path and the new file path. The old file path is the path to the file you want to rename, and the new file path is the path you want to rename the file to.

# To rename files in bulk, you first need to get a list of files in the directory you want to rename files in. The fs.readdir method is used to read the contents of a directory, and it returns an array of file names in the directory.

# Once you have the list of files, you can use a loop (such as forEach) to iterate over the files, and for each file, you can construct the old and new file paths using the directory path and the file name. You can then use the fs.rename method to rename the file.

# It's important to note that renaming files can be a potentially destructive operation, so it's a good idea to test your code on a small set of files before running it on a larger set of files. Additionally, you should ensure that the new file names you're generating are unique, so you don't accidentally overwrite existing files.
